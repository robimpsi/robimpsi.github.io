# Analyzing Customer Retention

In this project, I analyzed a dataset of 50,000 retail transactions to identify churn patterns.

## Methodology

I used the **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** analysis technique to segment customers.

## Key Findings

- Customers who purchased winter gear were 20% more likely to return the following year.
- Email campaigns targeted at "at-risk" customers showed a 5% conversion rate.

## Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)
- SQL
- Tableau for visualization
