### 🛍️ The Scenario
Imagine walking through your backroom and seeing rows of winter coats still on the hangers, even though it is already mid-May. You have thousands of dollars tied up in that wool and down, money that you cannot use to buy the summer dresses your customers are currently asking for. Your shelves look full, which might seem good at first glance, but your bank account is empty. This is the classic retail trap: ghost inventory that is taking up space without generating cash flow.

### 📊 The Stat: Inventory Turnover
Inventory Turnover is a simple ratio that tells you how many times you have sold and replaced your entire stock over a specific period. You calculate it by taking the total Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) and dividing it by your Average Inventory value. In simpler terms, it measures the speed at which your products move from the receiving dock to the customer shopping bag. A high turnover rate means you are moving goods quickly, while a low rate suggests your products are overstaying their welcome.

### 💡 The Insight
For a retailer, inventory is just cash that has been temporarily transformed into physical objects. If your turnover rate is two, it means you refresh your store twice a year. If your competitor has a turnover of six, they are turning their cash into profit three times faster than you are. Low turnover is often a warning sign of overstocking or poor product selection. Every day a SKU sits on your shelf, it loses value and costs you money in opportunity cost.

### 🚀 Quick Win
Open your Point of Sale (POS) system and run an inventory report for the last ninety days. Filter for items with zero sales or those with a turnover rate significantly below your store average. Select the bottom ten percent of these slow-movers and move them to a clearance rack today. Getting fifty percent of your money back now is better than keeping one hundred percent of a product that nobody wants to buy.
